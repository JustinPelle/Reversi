# Reversi
## Discription
This code was written an imperative programming course for my bachelor, in which we had to make the game called ‘Reversi’ in C# using Windows Forms. It’s a simple game, and didn’t pose much of a challenge to make, but I thought the end-product was quite clean. If I remember correctly, I ended up getting a 10 for it as a grade (out of 10).

## Dependencies
None, but he game uses C# windows forms, so it in can only run on Windows OS.

## Execution
The game can be run using the included .exe executable.
